Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
from tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
```
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used for plotting and visualization.
- `VGG16`: Pre-trained deep learning model for image classification provided by TensorFlow Keras.
- `load_img`, `img_to_array`, `preprocess_input`, `decode_predictions`: Functions from TensorFlow Keras for preprocessing images and decoding model predictions.

Step 2: Load the Pre-trained VGG16 Model
```python

model = VGG16()
```
- This line loads the pre-trained VGG16 model. VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

Step 3: Define a Function to Preprocess an Image
```python

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_preprocessed = preprocess_input(img_array)
    return img_preprocessed
```
- This function preprocesses an image for input to the VGG16 model. It loads an image from the given path, resizes it to the required input size of VGG16 (224x224 pixels), converts it to a NumPy array, expands its dimensions to match the input shape expected by VGG16, and applies preprocessing required by the model.

Step 4: Define a Function to Classify an Image
```python

def classify_image(image_path):
    img_preprocessed = preprocess_image(image_path)
    predictions = model.predict(img_preprocessed)
    label = decode_predictions(predictions)
    return label[0][0]
```
- This function classifies an image as a particular object or category. It preprocesses the image, predicts the probabilities for all classes using the VGG16 model, decodes the predictions to obtain human-readable labels, and returns the top prediction.

Step 5: Test the Classifier on an Example Image
```python

image_path = 'C:\\Users\\ABBAS SHAIK\\Downloads\\cat.jpg'
prediction = classify_image(image_path)
print('Predicted:', prediction[1], '-', prediction[2])
```
- This code tests the image classifier on an example image located at the specified `image_path`. It prints the predicted label and the associated probability.

WHERE The `image_path` variable in the provided code is the path to the image file that you want to classify. You need to replace `'C:\\Users\\ABBAS SHAIK\\Downloads\\cat.jpg'` with the actual path to the image file on your system.

For example, if your image file is named `example.jpg` and is located in the `C:\Users\YourUsername\Images` directory, you would set `image_path` as follows:

```python
image_path = 'C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Images\\example.jpg'
```

Make sure to replace `'YourUsername'` with your actual username and `'example.jpg'` with the name of your image file. Adjust the directory path as needed to reflect the actual location of the image file on your system.
Step 6: Display the Example Image
```python

img = load_img(image_path)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
- This code loads and displays the example image using matplotlib. It removes the axis labels for better visualization.

This code demonstrates how to use the pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification in TensorFlow Keras. It covers loading the model, preprocessing images, making predictions, and visualizing the results.
